# Performance

## Budget
One server tick advances every island by 50 ms of simulated time. **Budget: ≤ 5 ms of server time per
island per tick** (10 % of the tick). `/emergence perf` reports running averages in game;
`SolverBenchmarkTest` measures offline.

## Current measurements (dev machine, `coreTest --tests *SolverBenchmarkTest*`)
| Island | Unknowns | Steps/tick | ms/tick |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generator (human cranking, 20 rad/s) | 79 | ~24 | 1.8 |
| Gear train (cranked) | 31 | 10 | 0.55 |
| Capacitor glow / fuse (idle) | 42 | 10 | 0.6 |
| Conduction race | 28 | 10 | 0.33 |
| Flywheels | 18 | 10 | 0.24 |
| RC mesh 10×10 (50 Hz drive) | 101 | ~200 | 35 |
| RC mesh 30×30 | 901 | ~230 | 235 — **exceeds budget** |
| RC mesh 60×60 | 3601 | ~235 | 1040 — **exceeds budget** |

## History
* Generator 52 → 28 ms: coil flux LTE absolute tolerance was 1e-12 Wb (signal ~0.02 Wb); now scaled to the
  signal.
* 28 → 2.8 ms: primitive open-addressing index in the sparse matrix (no boxing); realistic human cranking
  (in-solver force–velocity model) instead of a constant 2 N·m that spun the rotor to 1000+ rad/s.

## Known bottlenecks and plan
1. **Large linear networks** take ~4× more steps than the 1 ms cap requires (LTE rejections on 2000+ RC
   states) and each step refactorises. Plan: (a) per-island accuracy level / relaxed tolerances for
   game-scale circuits, (b) skip the extra residual evaluation after convergence for linear islands,
   (c) cache the factorisation when the Jacobian is unchanged (linear networks, fixed h), (d) multirate:
   thermal nodes stepped at a coarser rate.
2. **Island compilation** (incl. 256-angle magnetic tables, ~0.1–0.5 s for coil/magnet islands) runs on the
   server thread when a structure changes. Plan: asynchronous compilation with the old model continuing.
3. **Sync** sends every island every tick; plan: distance culling and delta compression.
4. Parallel stepping of independent islands.
