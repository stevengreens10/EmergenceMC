# Development log

## 2026-10-08 — Session 1
**Foundation.** Chose MC 1.21.1 / NeoForge 21.1.219 / ModDevGradle 2.0.107 / Java 21 (cached locally,
mature API). Built the Minecraft-free core: SI units with dimension checks, JSON loader, 37-material
database, sparse/dense LU, unified multi-domain network with adaptive trapezoidal/BE/BDF2 integration,
Newton, LTE control, energy ledger, and electrical/mechanical/thermal elements with analytical tests.

**Solver lessons.** BDF2's numerical damping (~0.15 %/cycle) would kill clocks and pendulums → trapezoidal
default with ringing suppression. Inconsistent initial conditions poisoned trapezoidal history → the first
step after a restart is discarded from history. Floating conductive islands made pivots exactly zero in
floating point → relative GMIN for electrical nodes.

**Electromagnetics.** Surface-charge cuboid magnets, elliptic-integral loops, filament coils, co-energy
`MagneticSystem`. Generator (EMF ∝ ω, Lenz braking, energy closure) and synchronous motor emerge in tests.

**Assembly layer.** Grid parts → physics compiler (bodies, bearings, gears, contacts, heat, magnetics).
Bugs found by emergence tests: shafts welded to frames they merely pass (thin shafts now touch only at end
faces), component leads conducting through their alumina bodies (leads are copper).

**Minecraft integration.** Assembly block/entity, part items with data-component specs, placement and
removal, simulation manager with islands, renderer, multimeter, sync. GameTests run headless in-world.
Fixed a server deadlock (block-entity lookups during chunk unload).

**Demo world.** Exhibits defined in the core and validated by physics tests; builder, Gradle generation
pipeline, quick-play client, and an automated spectator screenshot tour that verified every exhibit visually
(found: square gears, invisible thin wires, missing switch sync, timing of glow capture, single-cell heat
allocation → all fixed).

**Performance.** Generator island 52 → 1.8 ms/tick (signal-scaled tolerances, primitive sparse index,
in-solver human effort model). Large linear networks remain over budget (see PERFORMANCE.md).
